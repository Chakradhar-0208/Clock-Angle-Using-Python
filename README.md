# Clock Angle Calculator
This is a simple Python script to calculate the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock for a given time.

# How it Works : 
The script takes the input of the time in the format HH:MM, where HH represents hours and MM represents minutes. It then calculates the angle between the hour and minute hands of the clock using the provided time.




# Usage :
To use the script, follow these steps:
- Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
- Run the script: python clock_angle_calculator.py
- When prompted, enter the time in the format HH:MM.

The script will output the angle between the hour and minute hands of the clock.


# Input Constraints :
Hours: `0` to `24`
Minutes: `0` to `60`

## Note :
- If an invalid time format or input is provided, the script will prompt for a valid input.
- If the provided time is not in the correct format (HH:MM), the script will display a message to enter it correctly.
